  <p class="para">Valhalla, the home of the gods. It is a guild for the most powerful mages to live, it's formation takes date back into the time where the world had no order and all it new was war. So, Valhalla was made to place order into the world, control the weak and order the strong. Those who got in their way were destroyed and those who decided to join their forces were spared. Valhalla has ruled over all until now, Ragnarok has come.
