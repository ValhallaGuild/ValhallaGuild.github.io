  <p class="para">Valhalla, the home of the gods. It is a guild for the most powerful mages to live, it's formation takes date back into the time where the world had no order and all it new was war. So, Valhalla was made to place order into the world, control the weak and order the strong. Those who got in their way were destroyed and those who decided to join their forces were spared. Valhalla has ruled over all until now, Ragnarok has come.

  <p class="para">Gama is the founder of Valhalla and the head of the Kurogane Clan.
    He is very wise and has a strong sense of "Good" and "Evil"
    Gama is also known for his use of Sun Magic, Visionary and "God Particle", some of the strongest magics known to man.

  <p class="para">Vilko is from an alternate future wherein he was the youngest offspring of Kurogane Gama and Lumia.
     In this alternate timeline, Dragons murdered his family and most of the life forms which inhabited Earth Land.
     Vilko traveled to the present timeline and eventually became Valhalla's third in command. Like his father,
     he uses Sun Magic and fights to protect the world from evil.

    or the <span class="wtaff"><i>Sacrifices</i></span> you've made, it only cares about stopping you from <span class="wtaff"><i>Prevailing</i></span>”</p>
  <p class="para">Denif is a short but clever mage who puts performance over emotion. He is the half-brother of Gama and tends to use magics that are simple at heart,
     but can do complicated things when used correctlt.</p>
